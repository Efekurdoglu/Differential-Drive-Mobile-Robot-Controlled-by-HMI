# Differential-Drive-Mobile-Robot
Differential Drive Mobile Robot Project via Data Logging.

### [Mobile Robot](https://github.com/Kucukcollu/Differential-Drive-Mobile-Robot/blob/master/MobileRobot.ino)

In the Mobile Robot circuit an SD card recorder was used to store LDR value, velocity state and motor velocity. The related 
datas were recorded in Excel format and velocity of mobile robot would be modified according to LDR value. To control robot, 
a mobile device or a tablet should be used. Communication was established by Bluetooth.

# Mobile Robot
The aim of this project is that design a mobile robot which has an obstacle detection module and control it with an HMI via motion of body parts. In this direction, related mechanics, electronics and software parts of a mobile robot is designed, developed and builded according to requirements.<br></br>

## [HMI](https://github.com/Kucukcollu/Mobile-Robot-Control-via-HMI/blob/master/HAND.ino)
To obtain the motion of hand, MPU6050 was used.The HMI controlled by Arduino Nano and comminication was established with NRF24L01.
